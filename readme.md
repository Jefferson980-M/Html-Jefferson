Description:
We start by using HTML5, a markup language used to structure and display content on the internet and is also compatible with mobile devices. Then we link our HTML with CSS, which is where we'll style the page.

Technologies used: HTML5 and CSS3

Here's the page in action:
https://jefferson980-m.github.io/Html-Jefferson/

Structure:

1- Create a folder called img where all the images we use in the multiple HTML files are stored.

2- Create the main HTML (index.html) for our page and link it with style.css to style the page.

3- We create the following two html and css for each section of the page.
